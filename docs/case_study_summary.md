# STRUDEL Kit Case Study: Climate Data Analysis Platform

## Introduction

This case study demonstrates how STRUDEL Kit, a React framework for research software engineers, can be used to create a comprehensive scientific application. The Climate Data Analysis Platform (CDAP) showcases STRUDEL's task flows and design system to create a user-centered application that addresses real needs in climate research.

## STRUDEL Kit Overview

STRUDEL (Scientific sofTware Research for User experience, Design, Engagement, and Learning) is a framework that enables teams to create user-centered software for scientific communities. It consists of:

1. **Planning Framework**: A conceptual tool for categorizing elements of scientific projects, helping identify and compare common activities in scientific work.

2. **Design System**: A set of reusable components and patterns organized around Task Flows, which are the stepwise flows a user takes to accomplish specified tasks.

3. **Task Flows**: Predefined interaction patterns for common scientific workflows, including:
   - Search Data Repositories
   - Explore Data
   - Compare Data
   - Run Computation
   - Run Interactive Computation
   - Monitor Activities
   - Contribute Data
   - Manage Account
   - Track State

## Example Application: Climate Data Analysis Platform

### Application Overview

The Climate Data Analysis Platform (CDAP) is a comprehensive web application that enables climate scientists, researchers, and policy makers to discover, explore, analyze, and share climate data. It integrates multiple STRUDEL task flows to create a seamless user experience for working with complex climate datasets.

### Why Climate Data Analysis?

Climate data analysis was selected as the optimal example application because:

1. It naturally incorporates multiple task flows in a cohesive workflow
2. Climate data is inherently complex (multidimensional, multivariate, temporal, spatial)
3. It requires diverse visualization capabilities
4. It spans from simple analyses to complex computations
5. It includes both individual and collaborative aspects
6. It addresses a scientifically relevant and broadly accessible domain

### Implemented Task Flows

The CDAP implements six key STRUDEL task flows:

1. **Search Data Repositories**: Enables users to search across multiple climate data repositories with advanced filtering options for variables, regions, time periods, and data sources.

2. **Explore Data**: Provides interactive visualization tools including maps, time series, and statistical summaries to help users understand climate datasets.

3. **Compare Data**: Allows side-by-side comparison of different climate datasets, models, or scenarios with difference calculation and statistical comparison tools.

4. **Run Computation**: Offers a workflow builder for configuring and executing climate analyses from simple statistical calculations to complex climate models.

5. **Monitor Activities**: Provides a dashboard for tracking the progress of long-running climate analyses and data processing tasks.

6. **Contribute Data**: Enables users to upload processed datasets, analysis results, or model outputs to share with the scientific community.

### User Interface Design

The CDAP interface is designed following STRUDEL's design system principles, with:

1. Responsive layout with adjustable panels
2. Task-based navigation structure
3. Consistent interaction patterns across all task flows
4. Specialized interfaces for each task flow
5. Integration between task flows for seamless workflows

### Technical Implementation

The application leverages STRUDEL Kit's React components and templates to implement:

1. Data integration with multiple climate data sources
2. Support for various climate data formats
3. Visualization components for different data types
4. Workflow management for computational tasks
5. Collaborative features for sharing and contribution

## Conclusion

This case study demonstrates how STRUDEL Kit provides a powerful framework for building scientific applications. By implementing the Climate Data Analysis Platform using STRUDEL's task flows and design system, research software engineers can create a comprehensive, user-centered application that addresses real scientific needs while maintaining development efficiency and consistency.
