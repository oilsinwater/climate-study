- [ ] Implement improved clear history and reuse search functionality

## Dataset Interface and Data Model

- [ ] Ensure Dataset type properly includes all required properties (addressing memory issue)
- [ ] Update card fields configuration to properly match dataset structure
- [ ] Implement better type safety throughout the application

## Component-Specific Updates

### DataListPanel

- [ ] Implement improved list view with better visual hierarchy
- [ ] Add sorting controls directly in panel header
- [ ] Enhance empty and loading states

### FiltersPanel

- [ ] Update filter control styling to match inspiration
- [ ] Implement collapsible filter sections
- [ ] Add "Clear All Filters" button
- [ ] Improve filter selection indicators

### PreviewPanel

- [ ] Enhance preview panel layout with tabbed sections
- [ ] Improve metadata organization
- [ ] Add action buttons for dataset operations
- [ ] Implement smoother open/close animations

### SearchInput

- [ ] Update styling with integrated search icon
- [ ] Improve suggestion dropdown design
- [ ] Add visual feedback during search operations

## Additional Features

- [ ] Implement dataset download/export options UI
